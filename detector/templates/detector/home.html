            Fake news is a term used to describe false or misleading information
            presented as if it were true, often with the intention of deceiving
            people. It can take the form of news articles, social media posts,
            videos, images, or other types of content. The spread of fake news
            has become a major problem in recent years and we've developed a
            machine learning and natural language processing project to help
            combat it.
